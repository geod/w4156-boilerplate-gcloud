Free beer & drinks, pizza, swag and more! Nick Makos, Director of Support, Actian A Database Month event http://www.DBMonth.com/database/analytical-database Are you concerned about your database's performance as you add data and new data-sources? Are you facing demands from business users who require real-time and ad-hoc analytics with quick-loading dashboards in their rapidly-expanding ecosystems? In this fun-filled session, you will learn about approaches to solving these and other performance problems while visualizing your data using a variety of tools. The present trend is to empower users to choose the best BI tool for the job rather than have IT prescribe a single tool that everyone must use; this session will help you understand how the queries work that power these visualization tools. We will also compare and explore the performance of the same datasets running on a variety of popular database systems.
